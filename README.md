# Netflix-Data-Cleaning-Analysis-and-Visualization
A data analytics project exploring Netflix’s catalog of movies and TV shows. Includes data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud). Built during my internship with Unified to uncover trends in genres, countries, ratings, and content growth.

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Netflix dataset to explore content distribution, trends, and insights into movies and TV shows. It demonstrates data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills.

👉 This work was completed as part of my internship with Unified.

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes details of Netflix content such as:
• Show ID – Unique identifier
• Title – Movie/Show name
• Director & Cast – Crew and actors
• Country – Origin of the show/movie
• Date Added – When it was added to Netflix
• Release Year – Year of release
• Rating – Content rating (e.g., PG, R, TV-MA)
• Duration – Duration in minutes or number of seasons
• Listed In – Genre/Category
