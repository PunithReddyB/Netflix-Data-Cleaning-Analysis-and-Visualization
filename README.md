# Netflix-Data-Cleaning-Analysis-and-Visualization
A data analytics project exploring Netflixâ€™s catalog of movies and TV shows. Includes data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud). Built during my internship with Unified to uncover trends in genres, countries, ratings, and content growth.
